## Basic concepts
A basic graphql server needs to have the following:
* type definitions
* resolvers
* a server that puts everything together

There are many choices for building the server that puts everything together. In apollo-server-example, I use apollo server. In apollo-express-example, I will use apollo server with express.js. The code for type definitions and resolvers is the same in both examples.
